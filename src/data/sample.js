        content:"Hurricane Beryl is a strong Atlantic hurricane moving across the northwestern Caribbean Sea, currently approaching the Yucatán Peninsula. Beryl is the second named storm, first hurricane, and first major hurricane[nb 1] of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. It is also the earliest-forming Category 5 Atlantic hurricane on record. After forming on June 28 in the Main Development Region, it began rapidly intensifying as it moved west through the central tropical Atlantic. On July 1, Beryl made landfall on the island of Carriacou in Grenada as a high-end Category 4 hurricane, causing extensive damage. The hurricane intensified further as it entered the Caribbean Sea, peaking as a Category 5 hurricane early the next morning before gradually weakening. Beryl caused catastrophic damage on Grenada's northern islands of Carriacou and Petite Martinique and on several of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines's southern islands such as Union Island and Canouan where many structures were damaged or destroyed. In Venezuela, ten people were killed and several were missing. As of July 4, a total of 22 fatalities have been confirmed,[1] and preliminary damage estimates are more than $1 billion.",
